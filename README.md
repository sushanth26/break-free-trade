# Break Free Trade

This project is now a React application powered by Vite and TypeScript. It recreates the "Trade
Journal Snapshot" experience with reusable components and strict linting.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Additional scripts:

- `npm run build` – type-check the project and create an optimized production build.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the configured TypeScript rules.
- `npm run typecheck` – run the TypeScript compiler without emitting files.

The static trade data lives in `src/data/calendar.ts`, while UI utilities are in
`src/utils/format.ts`.
